# BotStone

A bot aimed to provide some features that are lacking in discord - and a bit more.

## Using it

Sorry, for now you need to figure it yourself.
This bot is in very early development phases, so might change any moment.

## Credit

Significant amount of code is inspired from [CourtJester](https://github.com/bdashore3/CourtJester)
This bot was made possible by a great library and support
from acdenisSK over at [serenity](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity)
