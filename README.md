# BotStone

A bot aimed to provide some features that are lacking in discord - and a bit more.

## Using it

Simply run `docker-compose up -d` - it should setup fresh postgres database
as well as build and start the bot.

## Credit

Significant amount of code is inspired from [CourtJester](https://github.com/bdashore3/CourtJester)

This bot was made possible by a great library and support
from acdenisSK over at [serenity](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity)
